<div>
    <p>Optional regular expression (or string in trivial case) with name(s)
        of node(s) whose being online blocks the current node from starting.</p>

    <p>To properly take advantage of this, be sure to set low <tt>idleDelay</tt>
        timeout values for those other workers that no longer have work pending.</p>

    <p>Note that conflict is evaluated one way (<i>"should this node start
        if <tt>inDemandDelay</tt> has elapsed?"</i>), so all nodes in question
        should declare each other as conflicting -- e.g. by copying the regular
        expression, if such node names follow the same pattern. In any case,
        a node would not conflict with itself even if there is a match.</p>

    <p>As with other regular expressions, "negative look-ahead" can be used
        to exclude certain results from the following matching pattern, e.g.:</p>
    <pre>^(?!myServer$)(.*erver.*)$</pre>

    <p>This setting allows a Jenkins deployment to co-locate various pre-defined
        or otherwise provisioned build environments without overwhelming
        their host -- and instead permits round-robining, one by one.</p>
